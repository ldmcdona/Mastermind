Just a small project I wanted to do after I discovered this game existed. 
I learned it's name as 'Mastermind' but I have no idea if that is accurate. 

In this game you are trying to find the hidden number combination. 
Every number in the combination is only used once. 
If you guess a correct number in the wrong space the 'close' count will go up by one. 
If you guess a correct number in the correct space the 'match' count will go up one.

That's basically it. Tried to bug-proof the inputs.
